wpantund, Userspace WPAN Network Daemon
=======================================

`wpantund` is a user-space network interface driver/daemon that
provides a native IPv6 network interface to a low-power wireless
**Network Co-Processor** (or *NCP*). It was written and developed by
Nest Labs to make supporting [Thread](http://threadgroup.org)
connectivity on Unix-like operating systems more straightforward.

`wpantund` is designed to marshall all access to the NCP, ensuring
that it always remains in a consistent and well-defined state.

This is not an official Google product.

## Feature and Architecture Summary ##

`wpantund` provides:

 *  ... a native IPv6 interface to an NCP.
 *  ... a command line interface (`wpanctl`) for managing and
    configuring the NCP.
 *  ... a DBus API for managing and configuring the NCP.
 *  ... a way to reliably manage the power state of the NCP.
 *  ... a uniform mechanism for handling NCP firmware updates.

The architecture and design of `wpantund` has been motivated by the
following design goals (in no specific order):

 *  Portability across Unix-like operating systems (currently supports
    Linux and OS X. BSD support should be fairly trivial to add)
 *  Require few runtime dependencies (DBus, with boost needed when
    building)
 *  Single-threaded architecture, with heavy use of asynchronous I/O
 *  Power efficiency (0% CPU usage when idle)
 *  Allow management interface to be used by multiple independent
    applications simultaneously
 *  Allow multiple instances of `wpantund` to gracefully co-exist on a
    single machine
 *  Modular, plugin-based architecture (all details for communicating
    with a specific NCP stack are implemented as plugins)

Note that Windows is not currently supported, but patches are welcome.

The following NCP plugins are provided:

*   `src/ncp-spinel`: Supports NCPs that communicate using the [Spinel NCP
    Protocol][1], used by NCPs running [OpenThread][2]
*   `src/ncp-dummy`: A dummy NCP plug-in implementation meant to be the
    starting point for implementing new NCP plug-ins

## Conceptual Overview ##

`wpantund` is conceptually similar in purpose to the point-to-point
daemon (`pppd`, commonly used on Unix platforms to provide network
connectivity via a dial-up modems) except that instead of communicating
with a dial-up modem, `wpantund` is communicating with an NCP.

`wpantund` communicates with the NCP via an abstraction of a
asynchronous stream socket, which could be any of the following:

 *  A real serial port (UART) connected to the NCP (preferably with
    hardware flow control)
 *  The stdin and stdout from a subprocess (for supporting SPI
    interfaces using a translator program or debugging virtual
    stacks)
 *  A TCP socket (for debugging, not recommended for production)

Unlike a dial-up modem, NCPs often have a rich management interface
for performing operations, such as forming a network, joining a
network, scanning for nearby networks, etc. To perform these operations,
`wpantund` includes a command line utility called `wpanctl`.
Applications that need to directly configure the network interface can
also communicate directly with `wpantund` using its DBus API.

To expose a native IPv6 network interface to the host operating
system, `wpantund` uses the `tun` driver on Linux and the `utun`
driver on OS X. On Linux, the default name for the interface is
`wpan0`. On OS X, the default name is `utun0`.

## Usage Overview ##

The behavior of `wpantund` is determined by its configuration
parameters, which may be specified in a configuration file (typically
`/etc/wpantund.conf`) or at the command line. A typical configuration
file might look like that shown below. For a more thorough explanation
of available configuration parameters, see the [included example][5].

    # Try to name the network interface `wpan0`.
    # If not possible, a different name will be used.
    Config:TUN:InterfaceName      "wpan0"

    # The pathname of the socket used to communicate
    # with the NCP.
    Config:NCP:SocketPath         "/dev/ttyUSB0"

    # The name of the driver plugin to use. The chosen
    # plugin must support the NCP you are trying to use.
    Config:NCP:DriverName         "spinel"

    # Drop root privileges after opening all sockets
    Config:Daemon:PrivDropToUser  "nobody"

    # Use a CCA Threshold of -70db
    NCP:CCAThreshold              "-70"

When up and running, you can use `wpanctl` to check the status of the
interface and perform various management operations. For example, to
check the general status of an interface:

    $ sudo wpanctl status
    wpan0 => [
        "NCP:State" => "offline"
        "Daemon:Enabled" => true
        "NCP:Version" => "OPENTHREAD/g1651a47; May 23 2016 17:23:24"
        "Daemon:Version" => "0.07.00 (May 23 2016 12:58:54)"
        "Config:NCP:DriverName" => "spinel"
        "NCP:HardwareAddress" => [F1D92A82C8D8FE43]
    ]

Here we see that the NCP is in the `offline` state along with a few
additional bits of information such as the version of the NCP and its
hardware address. From here we can easily form a new network:

    $ sudo wpanctl form "wpantund-testnet"
    Forming WPAN "wpantund-testnet" as node type router
    Successfully formed!
    $

Now if we check the status, we will see more information:

    $ sudo wpanctl status
    wpan0 => [
        "NCP:State" => "associated"
        "Daemon:Enabled" => true
        "NCP:Version" => "OPENTHREAD/g1651a47; May 23 2016 17:23:24"
        "Daemon:Version" => "0.07.00 (May 23 2016 12:58:54)"
        "Config:NCP:DriverName" => "spinel"
        "NCP:HardwareAddress" => [F1D92A82C8D8FE43]
        "NCP:Channel" => 23
        "Network:NodeType" => "leader"
        "Network:Name" => "wpantund-testnet"
        "Network:XPANID" => 0x09717AEF221F66FB
        "Network:PANID" => 0xBFCD
        "IPv6:LinkLocalAddress" => "fe80::f3d9:2a82:c8d8:fe43"
        "IPv6:MeshLocalAddress" => "fd09:717a:ef22::9a5d:5d1e:5527:5fc8"
        "IPv6:MeshLocalPrefix" => "fd09:717a:ef22::/64"
    ]
    $ ifconfig wpan0
    wpan0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1280
        inet6 fe80::f3d9:2a82:c8d8:fe43%wpan0 prefixlen 10 scopeid 0x15
        inet6 fd09:717a:ef22::9a5d:5d1e:5527:5fc8 prefixlen 64

If compiled with `libreadline` or `libedit`, `wpanctl` supports an
convenient interactive console. All commands support online help: type
`help` to get a list of supported commands, or add `-h` to a command to get
help with that specific command.
